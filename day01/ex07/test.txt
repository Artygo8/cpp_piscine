Ooh, yeah
Well, alright
We're jammin'
Sing it, I want to jam it with you
We're jammin', we're jammin'
And I hope you like jammin' too
Ain't no rules, ain't no vow
You can do it anyhow
'Cause I and I will see you through
But every day we pay the price
Come a little sacrifice
jammin' 'til the jam is through
Ooh yeah, we're jammin', hey
To think that jammin' was a thing of the past
We're jammin', we're jammin'
And I hope this jam is gonna last
No bullet can stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can be bought nor sold
We all defend the right, Jah-Jah children must unite
'Cause life is worth much more than gold
Ooh yeah, we're jammin'
And we're jammin' in the name of the Lord
We're jammin', we're jammin'
And we're jammin' right straight from yard
Ay
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And ruleth all creation, hey, we're rammin'
I want to tell you that we're here and we're jammin'
I really mean it, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna jam it (I wanna jam it with you)
jammin', jammin'
And I hope you like jammin' too
Well, I hope you like jammin', I hope you like jammin'
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna jam with you
jammin', jammin'
Hope you like jammin' too
Well, well, well (jammin', jammin', jammin', jammin')
(I wanna jam it with you)
(jammin', jammin', jammin', jammin')
(Hope you like jammin' too)
Holy-holy
Holy-holy-holy (Zion) oh
jammin'
jammin'
I wanna jam it with you
